#### Test Driven Development (TDD) or Test First Development or Test Focused Development (TFD)

__Steps to read through this repository:__

**Step 1: Read test_app.py**

Based on the design, write test cases to each method you have designed. If you run the test this time, all the tests should fail.


**Step 2: Read app.py**

For each test case, write the corresponing class and methods. If you run the test this time, all the tests should pass.


**Important Notes**

1. It's not the case that we need to write all the test cases at one time. You should be writing one test case at a time, and testing that, and then writing the another. TDD is iterative and one test at a time process.

2. All the tests written here are just an example. They are not perfect like tests don't cover scopes, and boundary cases.
